**Stationary (Standing) Waves**
he modes of vibration associated with [resonance](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/reson.html#resdef) in extended objects like [strings](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/string.html#c1) and [air columns](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/standw.html#c4) have characteristic patterns called standing waves. These standing wave modes arise from the combination of [reflection](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/reflec.html#c1) and [interference](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/interf.html#c1) such that the reflected waves interfere constructively with the incident waves. An important part of the condition for this constructive interference for stretched strings is the fact that the waves [change phase](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/slink.html#c1) upon reflection from a fixed end. Under these conditions, the medium appears to vibrate in segments or regions and the fact that these vibrations are made up of travelling waves is not apparent - hence the term "standing wave".

 The behavior of the waves at the points of minimum and maximum vibrations ([nodes and antinodes](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/funhar.html#c3)) contributes to the constructive interference which forms the resonant standing waves. The illustration above involves the [transverse waves](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/tralon.html#c1) on a string, but standing waves also occur with the [longitudinal waves](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/tralon.html#c1) in an air column. Standing waves in air columns also form nodes and antinodes, but the phase changes involved must be separately examined for the case of air columns.

 All this is summarised well in the video below:

Note on **Nodes and Antinodes:**
The diagram shows that nodes are positions where there is complete destructive interference while at antinodes there is complete constructive interference.

# Part II - Stationary waves and resonance

**Objectives**
(d) describe experiments to demonstrate stationary waves using microwaves, stretched strings and air columns;
**(e)** determine the standing wave patterns for stretched string and air columns in closed and open pipes;
**(f)** use the equation: separation between adjacent nodes (or antinodes) = λ/2;
**(g)** define and use the terms *fundamental mode of vibration* and *harmonics*;
**(h)** determine the speed of sound in air from measurements on stationary waves in a pipe closed at one end.

**Guitar Strings**
A guitar string has a number of frequencies at which it will naturally vibrate. These natural frequencies are known as the harmonics of the guitar string and are associated with a standing wave pattern.

The diagram below depicts the standing wave patterns for the lowest four harmonics or frequencies of a guitar string.
 

![animation of the first four standng wave patterns on a fixed-fixed string](http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/StandingWaves/string-standing-2.gif)


 
The wavelength of the standing wave for any given harmonic is related to the length of the string.
 
The first harmonic is sometimes called the fundamental mode because it is the simplest wave that can be formed.
 
**Standing waves in a pipe closed at one end**
We can do the same as above for a resonating tube and be able to find wavelength or length of tube given the other and the harmonic.

 The particles immediately to the right in front of the piston move with the piston as it oscillates back and forth. Elsewhere in the pipe, the particles oscillate back and forth, right and left, though they are not all moving in the same direction at the same time; some are moving to the right while others are moving to the left. And, you should notice several locations (four, to be exact) where the particles do not move at all. I've placed three red particles in the pipe to illustrate the extremes of motion. One of the red particles does not move at all -- it is located at a **displacement node**, a location where the amplitude of the displacement always zero. Actually, the node is a line or plane that extends across the entire cross-section of the pipe. Notice that the particles to the right and left of this stationary node alternately move inward toward the node or outward away from the node. As the particles move toward the node, they become closer together and the local particle density at the node location increases (this would represent a compression). As the particles move outward away from the node the local particle density at the node location decreases (a rarefaction). To the right of this stationary red particle is another red particle that moves with maximum displacement; this particle is located at a displacement antinode. Notice that the local particle density near an antinode does not change as the particles move back and forth. The closed end of the pipe acts as a displacement node; the particles cannot move beyond the rigid end, so the displacement is zero at the closed end. The piston face acts as a displacement antinode; the particles move with maximum displacement amplitude.

**Middle animation: graph representing longitudinal particle displacement.**
The middle animation shows a graph representing the horizontal displacement of the air particles in the standing wave. When the graph is a horizontal line at zero all of the particles are at their equilibrium positions. Regions where the graph becomes positive represent regions where the particles are displaced from their equilibrium locations toward the right, in the positive *x*-direction. Regions where the graph becomes negative represent regions where the particles are displaced from their equilibrium positions toward the left, in the negative *x*-direction. Locations where the particle displacement graph is always zero correspond to the to the displacement nodes.
**Bottom animation: graph representing pressure variation.**
The bottom animation shows a graph representing the pressure variation associated with this standing sound wave. When the local density of the particles increases above the ambient value, the pressure variation is positive; this occurs when the particles are moving inward toward a displacement node location. When the local density of the particles decreases below the ambient value, the pressure variation is negative; this occurs when the particles move outward away from a displacement node location. If you compare the three animations, you'll notice that the pressure nodes (locations where the pressure is always zero) coincide with the displacement antinodes, there the local particle density does not change as the particles move back and forth together.

**2.**       (a)     In an investigation of standing waves, a loudspeaker is positioned above a long pipe containing water, causing sound waves to be sent down the pipe. The waves are reflected by the water surface. The water level is lowered until a standing wave is set up in the air in the pipe as shown in Fig. 1. A loud note is heard. The water level is then lowered further until a loud sound is again obtained from the air in the pipe. See Fig. 2.

         The air at the open end of of the pipe is free to move and this means that the antinode of the standing wave is actually a small distance *c* beyond the open end. This distance is called the end correction.
         A student writes down the following equations relating the two situations shown.
*l*1 **+ c = *λ*/4                            *l*2 **+ c = 3*λ*/4
(i)      Draw the standing wave in the pipe shown in Fig. 2 which corresponds to the equation *l*2 + c = 3λ/4.
[1]
 
(ii)      On your diagram, label the positions of any displacement nodes and antinodes with the letters N and A respectively.
[1]
 
(iii)     Use the two equations to show that *l*1 – *l*2 **= *λ*/2.
[1]
 
(iv)     The following results were obtained in the experiment.
          frequency of sound = 500Hz   *l*1 = 0.170 m   *l*2 = 0.506 m
          Calculate the speed of sound in the pipe.
speed = ………………..m s–1
[3]
 
(b)     The student repeats the experiment, but sets the frequency of the sound from the speaker at 5000 Hz.
         Suggest and explain why these results are likely to give a far less accurate value for the speed of sound than those obtained in the first experiment.
  *In your answer, you should make clear the sequence of steps in your argument.*
